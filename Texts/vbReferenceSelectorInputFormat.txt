=========================================
Formatting Rules for VB6 Reference Picker AHK Script:
=========================================

Reference names should be entered in full, exactly as they are labelled in the table.

All blank lines and lines which begin with a semicolon (;) will be ignored.

If any whitespace (tabs or spaces) precedes a line, it will be stripped off.

If there are multiple instances of the same name in references and you wish to get one besides the first, include a tab (	) and the number of the matched title you want (i.e., to pick the second, add tab and a 2 at the end of your title).
	
If many items have the same beginning or ending strings, you can use the following condensed syntax:
	Opening square bracket and a space to open a block ([ )
		After the space, you may include one or two items from the following, pipe (|) delimited:
			For a beginning string, a "b" and the string.
			For an ending string, a "e" and the string.
		Note that these arguments are inclusive of all spaces - include spaces after "b" or "e" only if you want to begin your prepend/postpend with a space, and include a space between the first argument and the pipe only if you want a space at the end of that string. Note that extra spaces can cause the script to not match those references.
	Closing square bracket to close a block.
