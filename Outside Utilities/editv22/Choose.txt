Choose/Choose32/Choose64 2.2
(C) 2006-2010 by Bill Stewart (bstewart@iname.com)

Description:

Choose/Choose32/Choose64 is intended for use in shell scripts (aka batch
files). It presents a list of choices and allows the user to select one of the
choices. The script can use Choose's exit code to determine which choice the
user selected. The program is provided in three versions:

*   CHOOSE.EXE - real-mode MS-DOS version; works in MS-DOS and in Windows 9x/Me
    COMMAND.COM sessions

*   Choose32.exe - Windows x86 (32-bit) console program

*   Choose64.exe - Windows x64 console program

In this documentation, Choose refers to any version of the program.

Choose is similar to the Microsoft Choice utility, but it has the following
advantages:

*   It doesn't beep when the user makes an invalid choice.

*   It offers a "default key" feature, which lets the user press Enter to
    select a default choice.

*   Choose supports multiple platforms (MS-DOS, Win32, and Win64).

*   Choose's timeout feature doesn't have problems when you run multiple
    instances of it in separate console windows (this was a problem with
    earlier versions of the Win32 version of Microsoft's Choice utility).

*   It can suppress the display of the user's choice.

*   It provides a line input mode where the user must press Enter after making
    a choice.

For these reasons, Choose may be preferable to Choice except in environments
where third-party executables are prohibited.

Usage:

Choose [-c choices] [-d x] [-l] [-n] [-p prompt] [-q] [-s] [-t x,n]

Arguments:

-c choices  Specifies valid choices. The default choices are 'YN'. If -s is
            used, the default choices are 'yn'.

-d x        Choose 'x' if the user presses Enter.

-l          Use line input mode (i.e., the user must press Enter after making a
            choice).

-n          Do not display the list of choices. Normally, Choose displays valid
            choices between '[' and ']' to prompt the user (e.g., '[Y,N]').

-p prompt   Specifies a prompt for the user. If it contains spaces or tabs,
            enclose it in quotes (").

-q          Do not display the selected choice (ignored when using -l).

-s          Choices are case sensitive.

-t x,n      Chooses 'x' automatically if the user doesn't make a choice within
            'n' seconds.

All command-line arguments are optional and may appear in any order.

If the /? argument is present and is first on the command line, the program
will display a short usage message.

Exit Codes:

0       The command line contains an error
1-254   The position of the user's choice in the list (e.g., 1 for the first
        choice, 2 for the second choice, etc.)
255     User pressed Ctrl-C to abort

Examples:

1.  choose32 -p "Are you sure?"

    This command will display the following prompt:

    Are you sure? [Y,N]

    If you press y or Y, Choose will return an exit code of 1; if you press n
    or N, it will return an exit code of 2. If you press Ctrl-C, Choose will
    return an exit code of 255.

2.  choose32 -p "Do you want to continue?" -t n,60

    Choose will wait for you to press Y, y, N, or n. If you don't type anything
    within 1 minute, Choose will answer "no" automatically.
