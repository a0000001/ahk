Version History

2.2: 18 Mar 2010

*   The executables are no longer compressed with UPX as this seems to cause
    false-positives with some anti-virus/anti-malware scanners.

2.1: 01 Jun 2009

*   Choose32 and Choose64 contained a bug that caused the keypad Enter and /
    keys to be ignored. Fixed. (Should have noticed this and fixed it back in
    version 1.7.)

2.0: 14 May 2009

*   Added 64-bit versions.

*   Compiled with Free Pascal 2.2.2. DOS and Win32 versions compressed with UPX
    3.03. As of this writing, UPX does not support compression of 64-bit
    Windows executables.

1.8: 3 April 2008

*   Fixed a Win32 version bug introduced by the bug fix in version 1.7.

1.7: 2 April 2008

*   Line input routine in the Win32 versions was ignoring the Enter and / keys
    on the numeric keypad. Fixed.

*   Compiled with Free Pascal 2.2.0 and compressed with UPX 3.02.

1.6: 7 March 2007

*   EditV32.exe used a list of characters that was too restrictive when
    checking whether a variable name contains illegal characters. This version
    greatly expands the list of characters allowed to be used in variable
    names.

*   EditV32.exe no longer converts the environment variable's name to
    uppercase.

1.5: 12 September 2006

*   Added the -e argument for EditV32.exe.

*   The programs are now compiled with Free Pascal 2.0.4 and compressed with
    UPX.

1.4: 21 April 2006

*   EditVar/EditV32 had a bug with the -u option if the initial character of
    the variable to edit was lowercase. This has been fixed.

1.3: 18 April 2006

*   Found out that COMMAND.COM does indeed allow spaces in a variable name.
    Updated the MS-DOS version also.

1.2: 18 April 2006

*   On advice from Phil Robyn and others in the microsoft.public.win2000
    .cmdprompt.admin newsgroup, added the space character as a legal character
    in an environment variable name in the Win32 version.

1.1: 17 April 2006

*   Fixed a (minor) bug in the line editor.

*   Fixed bugs in MS-DOS environment access for EditVar.exe.


1.0: 14 April 2006

*   Initial version. EditV32 and Choose32 are loosely based on two older
    programs I wrote called Getkey and Getvar, and are intended to replace
    them.
